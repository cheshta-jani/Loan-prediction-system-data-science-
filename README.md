# Loan-prediction-system- (data-science) using python
Developed an AI model to determine loan approval using python. It first, pre-process the data and then train & test the data using different models/techniques. Also, printed accuracy of each model in predicting, in order to compare which model works better.


The notebook (.pynb) file contains features like:
-heatmap figure which can be used to understand the relativity, relationship and impact of variables
-Performs prediction using logistic regression
-Performs prediction using Random Forest Classifier
-Performs prediction using KNN regressor
-Performs prediction using SVC (Support Vector Classifier)

-Imports libraries named Axes3D for 3D plotting of graphs, standard scaler for preprocessing the data, numpy for linear algebra and other basic libraries
